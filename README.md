Welcome to the CodeAnt.ai! This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and build performance.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of this repository and `<repository-name>` with the name of the cloned folder.

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the development server

Start the Vite development server:
